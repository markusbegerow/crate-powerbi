What is CrateDB?
=====

CrateDB is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze
massive amounts of data in real-time.

CrateDB offers the benefits of an SQL database *and* the scalability and
flexibility typically associated with NoSQL databases. Modest CrateDB clusters
can ingest tens of thousands of records per second without breaking a
sweat. You can run ad-hoc queries using standard SQL. CrateDB's blazing-fast
distributed query execution engine parallelizes query workloads across the
whole cluster.

What is Power BI native connector for CrateDB?
=====

The new native Power BI connector for CrateDB connects Power BI Desktop to a cluster of a CrateDB instance.
